Rain had stopped at around 7:30pm and allowed the match to start at 9:45pm, but it relented for just over an hour.The rain first delayed the match and was later restricted to 12-overs-a-side before Ireland captain William Porterfield won the toss and sent Bangladesh into bat first.However, Bangladesh batted at nearly 12 runs per over and when they reached 94 for two in just eight overs, rain again stopped the play and later the match was abandoned. Both teams were allotted one point each in the no-result match.Opener Tamim Iqbal made 47 off 26 balls, hitting four sixes and three boundaries.";
